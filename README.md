# Bike_Rental_Prediction
 Bike Sharing Dataset from the Capital Bikeshare System using Regression Modeling 

+ In this project, we would gladly use this dataset from Capital Bikeshare to analyze and provide enhancement to their business. The bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of the week, season, an hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. The core data set is related to the two-year historical log corresponding to the years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system.
Created a model to predict the usage of the bike-share, in order for Capital Bikeshare to increase the efficiency of available bikes in Washington DC station. So they would not oversupply or undersupply the number of available bikes based on environmental and seasonal setting (for example during commute hours, holidays, or any weather condition)

+ This project will use supervised machine learning. Using regression to predict the total number of bike-share from the dataset.

+ In order to measure the performance of the regression model, we use the following metrics: R2 Score and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
